The objective of this project was to design, simulate, and verify a basic Digital Filter using Verilog HDL within the Xilinx Vivado Design Suite. Digital filters are essential components in digital signal processing (DSP) systems, used to remove unwanted components or features from a signal. This project focused on designing a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter – a commonly used digital filter type – and simulating its behavior with test data.
